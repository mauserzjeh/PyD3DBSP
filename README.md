# PyD3DBSP
Blender add-on for importing Call of Duty 2 map files

Current status:
  - Basic import of map geometry from .d3dbsp files
  - Possibly working UVs (there is a small chance they are wrong, because the feature wasn't tested too much yet)
  - Vertex colors (needs polish)
  
TODO:
  - Custom Normals
  - Materials & textures
  - Entities
